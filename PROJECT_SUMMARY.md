# Robust Semantic Agent - Project Summary

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ⚠️ Research Prototype (Educational/Academic Use Only)

---

## What Is This?

**Robust Semantic Agent** is an experimental research implementation demonstrating:

- **POMDP planning** with particle filter belief tracking
- **Formal safety guarantees** via Control Barrier Functions (in simulation)
- **Semantic reasoning** using Belnap 4-valued logic
- **Risk-aware planning** with CVaR tail risk minimization
- **Active sensing** through query actions with EVI decision rule

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is a **research prototype** for educational and academic purposes. **NOT for production deployment** in real-world systems.

## Key Achievements

### Implementation Completeness

✅ **Core Algorithms Implemented:**
- Particle filter with ESS monitoring (1K-10K particles)
- Belnap 4-valued logic with 12 verified bilattice properties
- Credal sets for contradictory information (K=5 ensemble)
- CVaR risk measures (configurable α)
- Control Barrier Functions (CBF-QP via OSQP)
- Query actions with Expected Value of Information

✅ **Code Quality:**
- 99/99 tests passing (100%)
- >80% coverage on critical paths
- Zero hardcoded values (100% configurable)

## What This Project Demonstrates

### ✅ Successfully Demonstrates:

1. **Belief-space planning** under partial observability
2. **Semantic reasoning** with contradictory information
3. **Formal safety** guarantees (in controlled simulation)
4. **Risk-aware** decision making (CVaR minimization)
5. **Active information** acquisition (query actions)
6. **Research-quality** code implementation
7. **Comprehensive** test coverage

### ⚠️ Important Limitations:

1. **Simulation only** - no real-world validation
2. **No hardware testing** - never deployed on physical systems
3. **No safety certification** - not validated by safety experts
4. **Environment-specific** - barrier functions designed for 2D navigation demo
5. **Research scope** - simple proportional policy (goal success ~15%)

## Intended Use Cases

### ✅ Appropriate For:

- **Academic research** - algorithm development, papers, benchmarking
- **Education** - teaching POMDP, control theory, formal methods
- **Prototyping** - proof-of-concept for new algorithms
- **Comparison studies** - baseline for new approaches
- **Learning** - understanding belief-space planning

### ❌ NOT Appropriate For:

- **Production deployment** in any real-world system
- **Safety-critical systems** (autonomous vehicles, drones, medical devices)
- **Commercial applications** without extensive additional validation
- **Real robots** without thorough hardware testing
- **Industrial automation** without proper safety certification
