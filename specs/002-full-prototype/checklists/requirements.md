## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality** ✅
- Spec describes WHAT the agent does (navigate safely, handle contradictions, acquire information) without specifying HOW (e.g., avoids mentioning Python, NumPy, specific algorithms)
- Focuses on researcher's needs (validate theoretical guarantees, generate reports, configure experiments)
- Accessible to domain experts (reinforcement learning researchers) without requiring implementation knowledge
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness** ✅
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and specific
- Every FR is testable (e.g., FR-002 "total variation distance ≤ 1e-6" is directly measurable)
- Success criteria are quantitative (SC-001: "zero forbidden zone entries", SC-008: "ECE ≤ 0.05")
- Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., SC-009 says "30+ Hz performance" not "NumPy vectorization achieves 30+ Hz")
- Five user stories with complete Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases cover failure modes (belief collapse, safety infeasibility, credal explosion, query loops, trust drift)
- Scope is bounded to the Robust Semantic Agent prototype (not a general RL framework)
- Dependencies explicit in FR-015 (must validate against docs/theory.md)

**Feature Readiness** ✅
- Each of 15 functional requirements maps to at least one success criterion (e.g., FR-002 commutative updates → SC-003 TV distance test)
- Five user stories cover: core navigation (P1), contradiction handling (P2), query action (P3), calibration (P4), reporting (P5)
- Success criteria are measurable outcomes that validate the specification goals
- No leakage of implementation details (particle filters, CVaR algorithms, QP solvers are mentioned only as required mathematical operations from theory.md, not as design choices)

## Notes

- Specification successfully avoids implementation bias while remaining concrete and testable
- Mathematical notation (β_t, CVaR@α, τ/τ', etc.) references formal specification in docs/theory.md rather than prescribing implementation
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-014 provide comprehensive validation coverage across all three subsystems (Risk, Safety, Semantics)
- Edge cases anticipate realistic failure modes and specify expected handling behavior
- User stories are prioritized by dependency: P1 (core integration) must work before P2 (contradictions) and P3 (query) can be validated
